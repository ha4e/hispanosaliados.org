## Recommended: Install Proton apps and extensions

**We strongly recommend** installing Proton apps and extensions on every device you use for HA4E. You’ll get secure access to Mail, Pass, and Drive without relying on the browser alone, and Proton Pass will autofill logins and generate aliases when you need them.

- **Phones (Android / iOS):** Install the **Proton Mail** and **Proton Pass** apps from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/proton-mail/id979659905) (iOS) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.protonmail.android) (Android). Add **Proton Drive** if you use shared files on the go.
- **Laptops / desktops:** Install the **Proton Pass** browser extension so you can autofill passwords and use single-use aliases when signing up for services. Available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/proton-pass/ghmbeldphafepmbegfdlkpapadhbakde), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/proton-pass/hnmbkbjnpajccljcpjodhjgncfjgncgb), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/proton-pass/), and [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/proton-pass/id6443490629). For email on a laptop, you can use [proton.me/mail](https://proton.me/mail) in the browser or install the [Proton Mail desktop app](https://proton.me/mail/download) if you prefer a dedicated app.

Using these apps and extensions keeps HA4E accounts secure and makes it easier to use Proton Pass for Squarespace, GiveButter, Stripe, and Netlify without copying passwords by hand.

## Domains

- **Primary domain:** **www.hispanosaliados.org** — Canonical site URL (apex hispanosaliados.org redirects here). Email uses hispanosaliados.org (info@, etc.).
- **Secondary domain:** **ha4e.org** — Redirects to www.hispanosaliados.org for the website (http/https and www are configured in **Squarespace**, not Netlify). Use **ha4e.org** for email aliases, including single-use addresses generated by Proton Pass (see below). Mail sent to any of these aliases is delivered to the **info@hispanosaliados.org** inbox.

---

## 1. Proton Mail — Main inbox

**URL:** [proton.me/mail](https://proton.me/mail) (or [mail.proton.me](https://mail.proton.me))

- **Primary address:** **info@hispanosaliados.org**
- **Aliases (same inbox):**
  - partnerships@hispanosaliados.org  
  - scholarships@hispanosaliados.org  
  - rose@hispanosaliados.org  
  - pablo@hispanosaliados.org  

All of these deliver to the same Proton Mail inbox. Use the address that fits the context (e.g. scholarships@ for scholarship inquiries).

Mail sent to **ha4e.org** aliases (including single-use addresses created in Proton Pass) also arrives in this inbox.

---

## 2. Proton Pass — Sensitive information

**URL:** [proton.me/pass](https://proton.me/pass)

Use Proton Pass for:

- **Passwords** — All account logins (Squarespace, GiveButter, Stripe, Netlify, etc.)
- **Credit/debit cards** — For org purchases or donations
- **Bank account details** — For payouts and accounting
- **EIN** and other tax/legal identifiers
- **API keys** or other secrets, if any
- **Single-use email aliases** — When signing up for services online, use Proton Pass to generate a unique **@ha4e.org** address instead of giving out info@. These aliases forward to the info@ inbox and help keep the main address private and reduce spam.

**Tip:** When you log into Squarespace, GiveButter, Stripe, or Netlify, open Proton Pass and store or update the login there so the next person has access.

---

## 3. Proton Drive — Shared files

**URL:** [proton.me/drive](https://proton.me/drive)

Use Proton Drive to:

- Store files that need to be available on multiple computers
- Share folders with other HA4E staff (if needed)
- Keep sensitive documents in one place, synced across devices

Same Proton account as Mail and Pass; sign in with your Proton credentials.

---

## 4. Squarespace — Domain management

**URL:** [squarespace.com](https://www.squarespace.com) → log in → **Domains**

- **Domains:** hispanosaliados.org (primary), ha4e.org (redirects to primary; used for email aliases)  
- **Use for:** Renewals, DNS, connecting domain to Netlify (if applicable)  
- **Credentials:** Stored in Proton Pass (search for “Squarespace”)

---

## 5. GiveButter — Donation widget

**URL:** [givebutter.com](https://givebutter.com) → log in

- **Use for:** Donation campaigns, widget on [www.hispanosaliados.org/donate](https://www.hispanosaliados.org/donate.html), viewing donations  
- **Credentials:** Stored in Proton Pass (search for “GiveButter”)  
- **Note:** Stripe is connected to GiveButter for payment processing; no need to log into Stripe for day‑to‑day donations unless you’re changing payout or tax settings.

---

## 6. Stripe — Payment processing

**URL:** [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)

- **Use for:** Payouts from GiveButter, tax documents, payment method/bank account updates  
- **Credentials:** Stored in Proton Pass (search for “Stripe”)  
- **Integration:** Used by GiveButter; configure connection in GiveButter if you change Stripe accounts.

---

## 7. Netlify — Website hosting

**URL:** [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)

- **Use for:** Deploying the live site (hispanosaliados.org), viewing form submissions (contact, newsletter), build logs  
- **Credentials:** Stored in Proton Pass (search for “Netlify”)  
- **Site:** The HA4E site is linked to the Netlify account; new deploys (e.g. from Git or drag‑and‑drop) go live from here.

The website collects form input from visitors (e.g. the **Contact** form and **newsletter signup** in the footer). All submissions are stored in Netlify and can be viewed or exported from the Forms dashboard: **[Netlify Forms — hispanosaliados](https://app.netlify.com/projects/hispanosaliados/forms)**.

### How to update the website with Netlify Drop

Use **Netlify Drop** when you have an updated version of the site and want to publish it without using Git.

1. **Get the built site.** You need the **built** site (the `public` folder), not the raw source.
   - **If you have the full project** (with [Babashka](https://babashka.org/) installed): open a terminal in the project folder and run `make build`. That creates (or updates) the `public` folder.
   - **If a developer sent you an update:** use the `public` folder or zip they provided (it should contain `index.html`, `about.html`, `assets/`, etc. at the top level).
2. **Log in to Netlify.** Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) and open the **hispanosaliados** site (credentials in Proton Pass).
3. **Deploy with Drop.** On the site’s overview, find the **Deploys** area. Drag the **`public` folder** (or a zip of its contents) onto the “Deploy manually” / drop zone. Netlify will upload and publish; the live site at www.hispanosaliados.org will update once the deploy finishes.

Each new drop replaces the current live site with what you uploaded. To preview before going live, you can use a different Netlify site or a draft deploy if you use Git-based deploys later.

## Quick checklist for new staff

1. Get access to the **Proton** account (Mail, Pass, Drive) from the person who manages it.  
2. **Install Proton apps and extensions** (see section above): Proton Mail and Proton Pass on your phone; Proton Pass browser extension (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari) on your laptop.  
3. Open **Proton Pass** and confirm you can see logins for: Squarespace, GiveButter, Stripe, Netlify.  
4. Log into **Proton Mail** and confirm you see info@hispanosaliados.org and the aliases (partnerships@, scholarships@, rose@, pablo@).  
5. Optionally log into **Netlify** and **GiveButter** once using Proton Pass, to verify access and see where forms and donations appear.
