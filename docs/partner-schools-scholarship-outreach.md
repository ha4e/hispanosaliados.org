# Partner Schools Scholarship Outreach

Guide for reaching out to HA4E partner trade schools to gather current scholarship and financial-aid information so we can refer Hispanic students more effectively and align HA4E scholarship efforts with partner programs.

---

## Recommended approach

1. **Lead with partnership context**  
   Use **partnerships@hispanosaliados.org**. Introduce yourself (Executive Director or designee) and state that HA4E is gathering up-to-date scholarship and financial-aid information to improve referrals and explore how HA4E-funded or other external scholarships might work with their programs.

2. **Ask each school for**
   - Scholarship programs (institutional or partner-funded) that trade or Hispanic students can use
   - Eligibility and how to apply
   - Preferred contact (name, title, email, phone) for scholarship/financial aid and for partnership discussions
   - Whether they accept or match external scholarships (e.g., HA4E-funded)

3. **Follow up**  
   After collecting responses, update internal notes and share back with the team (e.g., a short “Scholarship contacts” summary or this doc with notes).

## Sample outreach verbiage

### Email template (initial outreach)

**Subject:** Partnership inquiry – scholarship information for Hispanic students

**Body:**

> Hello,
>
> I'm [Executive Director name], Executive Director of Hispanos Aliados for Education (HA4E), a Houston-area nonprofit that empowers Hispanic youth through mentorship, trade-school awareness, and scholarships. We list [School name] among our partner trade schools and refer students your way.
>
> We're reaching out to our partner schools to gather up-to-date information on scholarship and financial-aid options so we can refer students more effectively and explore how HA4E-funded or other external scholarships might work with your programs.
>
> Could you please share:
> - Scholarship programs (institutional or partner-funded) that trade or Hispanic students might use
> - Eligibility and how to apply
> - The best contact (name, title, email, phone) for scholarship and partnership questions
> - Whether you accept or match external scholarships (e.g., from community organizations like HA4E)
>
> I'm happy to schedule a short call if that's easier. Thank you for the work you do for students in our community.
>
> Best regards,  
> [Name]  
> Executive Director, Hispanos Aliados for Education  
> partnerships@hispanosaliados.org

**Usage:** Send from partnerships@hispanosaliados.org; replace [Executive Director name], [School name], and [Name] for each school.

### Phone script (short version for live calls)

**When connected (front desk / main line):**

> Hi, I'm [Name] with Hispanos Aliados for Education, a nonprofit that partners with trade schools and refers Hispanic students. I'm calling to get current information on your scholarship and financial-aid options so we can refer students better. Who would be the best person to talk to—Financial Aid, Admissions, or a partnership contact?

**When transferred to Financial Aid / Admissions / right contact:**

> Thanks for taking my call. I'm [Name], Executive Director of Hispanos Aliados for Education. We list [School name] as a partner and refer students to you. We're updating our information on scholarships and financial aid so we can refer students more effectively and see how our own scholarship program might work with yours.
>
> Could you tell me: (1) what scholarship or aid options you'd want us to highlight for Hispanic or trade students, (2) how students apply, and (3) whether you accept or match external scholarships from organizations like ours? If there's a better contact for partnership discussions, I'm happy to follow up with them.

**If they ask for something in writing:**

> I can send a short email to [their email] with these questions and our contact info. What's the best address?

**Closing:**

> Thank you—this helps us refer the right students and support them through your programs.

**Usage:** Replace [Name] and [School name]; keep tone conversational; take notes on contact names and any deadlines or forms they mention.
