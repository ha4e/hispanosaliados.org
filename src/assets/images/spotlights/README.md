# Spotlight photos

Add one image per spotlight, e.g. `january-2026.jpg` or `january-2026.png`. Reference the path in `src/content/spotlights.edn` as `/assets/images/spotlights/january-2026.jpg`. The build copies this folder and generates WebP/AVIF alongside the source image for the spotlight `<picture>`.
