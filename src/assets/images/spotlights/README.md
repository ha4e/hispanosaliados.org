# Spotlight photos

Add one image per spotlight, e.g. `january-2026.jpg` or `january-2026.png`. Reference the path in Decap CMS (or in `src/content/en/spotlights.json` / `src/content/es/spotlights.json`) as `/assets/images/spotlights/january-2026.jpg`. The build copies this folder and generates WebP/AVIF alongside the source image for the spotlight `<picture>`.
