# About Hispanos Aliados for Education

Hispanos Aliados for Education (HA4E) is more than just a non-profit; it's a movement that aims to transform communities!

## Why Us?

Our vision is simple yet powerful: to create a fairer, more humane world full of opportunities for every Hispanic American. From promoting merit-based education and trade skills training because once one person in a family is educated, the quality of life of the whole family improves. We know industries need trade skill workers. We will change the lives of Hispanic Americans.

We will look to enhance their healthcare and advocate for the rights of vulnerable communities. HA4E will deliver. Education can have a lasting impact on an individual, a family, and society. HA4E does not just aim to help... we aim to change lives!

Hard working Hispanic Americans from the past to the present have paved the way for our young people to begin dreaming about the endless possibilities, and for generations to come to understand that through education they can have a lasting impact on themselves as individuals, their families, and our society. We want every young Hispanic American who believes in a better future to feel welcome and find their place within HA4E.
