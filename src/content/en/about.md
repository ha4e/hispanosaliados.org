Hispanos Aliados for Education (HA4E) is more than just a non-profit; it's a movement that aims to transform communities!

## Why Us?

Our vision is simple yet powerful: to create a fairer, more humane world full of opportunities for every Hispanic American. From promoting merit-based education and trade skills training because once one person in a family is educated, the quality of life of the whole family improves. We know industries need trade skill workers. We will change the lives of Hispanic Americans.

We will look to enhance their healthcare and advocate for the rights of vulnerable communities. HA4E will deliver. Education can have a lasting impact on an individual, a family, and society. HA4E does not just aim to help... we aim to change lives!

Hard working Hispanic Americans from the past to the present have paved the way for our young people to begin dreaming about the endless possibilities, and for generations to come to understand that through education they can have a lasting impact on themselves as individuals, their families, and our society. We want every young Hispanic American who believes in a better future to feel welcome and find their place within HA4E.

## Hispanic Americans: Our Heritage

Empowering and Inspiring a generation of Hispanic Americans through education and skills training.

Hispanic Americans are Americans! We Are Proud People! We Work Hard! We Vote! We Live! We Play! We Are Families!

Historically, Hispanic Americans have made great contributions to the fabric of the United States of America. Let us take a look at so many who have made and continue to make an indelible mark. The rich and immeasurable gifts and their unselfish service have inspired and continues to inspire generations of Hispanic Americans.

Since the creation of the Medal of Honor by the United States Congress in 1861, 60 Hispanic Americans have been awarded the nation's highest decoration for bravery and self-sacrifice in combat. These heroic individuals and their deeds of valor date back to the American civil war through the most recent campaign in the Middle East.

Hispanic Americans Entrepreneurs, Restauranteurs, Fashion Designers, Orchestras Conductors, Architects, Engineers, Attorneys, Construction workers, and countless other kind and loving people who have enriched our lives and have set examples by fulfilling their calling in life.

Hispanic Americans from the past to the present have paved the way for our young people to begin dreaming about the possibilities because education can have a lasting impact on an individual, a family, and society. Through example, inspiration, and the immense contributions that Hispanic Americans have given to our Nation, young Hispanic American families quality of life improves when one member of that family is educated.

Young Hispanic Americans should be able to dream and dream big, just like those who came before them and know they have the opportunity to make their dreams come true. Sadly, many of our young Hispanic Americans have had to drop out of high school or community colleges to get a job to help their families survive thus putting their dreams on hold, but it does not have to stay that way because Hispanos Aliados for Education can be effective in their lives.
