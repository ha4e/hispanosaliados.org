Our programs focus on three main areas: High School Outreach, Trade School Awareness, and Scholarships.

## High School Outreach Programs

We visit high schools and connect directly with students to talk about trade careers, education, and real-world success stories. Our presentations focus on the Houston area initially, with plans to expand across Texas.

## Trade School Awareness Initiative

We bridge the gap between schools and trade institutions, helping students discover rewarding career paths in construction, HVAC, welding, electrical, cosmetology, and more.

## Scholarship Program

We provide scholarships to help Hispanic students pursue trade school education. Every dollar helps provide scholarships and expand trade awareness in schools.
